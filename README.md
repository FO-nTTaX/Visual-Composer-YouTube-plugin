# Visual-Composer-YouTube-plugin
Wordpress plugin that enhances the WPBakery Visual Composer with a better YouTube module.

This is a Wordpress Plugin, that extends the Visual Composer by WPBakery with a new module. The added module allows to add a YouTube video with a custom thumbnail infront of it, that starts the video when clicked.

Since the Plugin only adds the YouTube iframe on click, it also saves data volume for every video that is not actually clicked.
